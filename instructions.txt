f1_model.py is the main file, it should output several different figures relating to our models and particularly cross-validation and hyper-parameter selection

scrape_all.py is the main file used for data gathering which became quite complex

processing.py was used to process the data in different areas (you would need to write the main function to determine which custom functions to use to alter the data)

other python files are older workspaces

there is a selection of different data files but the one that was used in the submission is withcompounds.csv which includes the c1-c5 tyre compounds
